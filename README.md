Weather Update Application üå§Ô∏è
This is a full-stack web application built with React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Express.js on the backend. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather updates for any city based on a specified date.

Project Overview
This application allows users to input a city name and a date to receive weather updates, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The backend fetches data from OpenWeatherMap's API, processes it, and serves it to the frontend for a smooth user experience.

The frontend server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Application Workflow
User Input: The user enters a city name and date.
Data Fetching: The frontend sends a request to the backend, which then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
Display Results: The weather information is displayed on the frontend.
Usage
After both the frontend and backend servers are running:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Enter a city name and date to get the weather update.
The application will display temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions.
