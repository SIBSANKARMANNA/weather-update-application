# AI Integration Web Application ðŸ¤–
This is a full-stack web application that integrates AI features, including sentiment analysis and content recommendation. The app has both a user-facing interface and an admin dashboard. It is built with React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Express.js on the backend, with MongoDB for database management. User security is handled with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcryptjs for password hashing.

## Project Overview
This web application provides a platform where users can:
- Perform sentiment analysis on text input.
- Get personalized content recommendations based on user preferences.
- View and manage their profile, including their profile picture and email.
- Admin users can manage other users, including deleting users and creating new admin users.

The application uses role-based access control, where only admin users can access the admin dashboard, while normal users can only interact with their profiles, sentiment analysis, and content recommendations.
